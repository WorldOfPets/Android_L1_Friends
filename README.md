# Friends
### Small mobile application "Friends". I comprehend moxy and mvp.
1. Libraries used: **moxy-community**, **okhttp**, **gson**, **circularprogressview**.
2. The application uses the **MVP** pattern and the **View Binding** feature.
3. There is one adapter and one async request.
##### P.S. It was a very interesting experiment, the application can be used as a simple training example.
